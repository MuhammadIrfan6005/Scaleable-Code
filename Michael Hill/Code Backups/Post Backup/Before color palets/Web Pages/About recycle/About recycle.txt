                    <p>Ancient and immortal, gold is a gift from the earth that is eternally crafted, loved, and recrafted. </br>
                    It captures the stories, moments and memories we pour into it. Each speck of raw, natural gold is brimming with possibilities. Now, you can recycle it and give it new life.
                    </p>
                    <p>The process is simple. All you need to do is send your piece in, and weâ€™ll give you a Michael Hill Gift Card to spend on a new heirloom to treasure for years to come.
Gold has never had a kinder touch.
